# HandFollower

This component will force an object to follow the specified hand of a user. It's used, for example, in the Flipside onboarding experience to attach a particle effect to your hands while you record a dance.

Note that you can also specify for an object to follow the user's head or a custom transform, so you can use it to have objects that follow the movement of other objects than just the user's hands.

You can also adjust the smoothing value to decide whether the object should follow more precisely or with more smooth movement.

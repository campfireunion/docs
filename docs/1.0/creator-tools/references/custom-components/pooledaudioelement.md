# PooledAudioElement

Positions an audio playback location on set that, when triggered, uses Flipside's AudioSource pool so you can use a larger number of audio sources without hitting Unity's limits.

Basic options:

* **Audio Clips** - A list of preset clips that can be played by calling **PlayOneShot(index)**.
* **Auto-Play Clip** - A clip from the list to auto-play. Default is -1, which means don't auto-play.
* **Loop** - Should playback loop? Default is false.
* **Volume** - The audio volume. Default is 1.
* **Override Audio Source** - An optional individual AudioSource to use instead of using a pooled source.

Spatialization options:

* **Spatialized** - Whether to spatialize the audio or not. Default is true.
* **Gain** - Gain to apply to the spatialized audio. Default is 0.
* **Near** - Near attenuation distance. Default is 0.25 meters.
* **Far** - Far attenuation distance. Default is 100 meters.
* **Volumetric Radius** - An optional volumetric radius. Default is 0.
* **Reverb Send Level** - An optional reverb send level. Default is 0.

* **PlayOneShot(index)** - Play the specified audio clip from the list as a one-shot.
* **PlayOneShot(clip)** - Play a specified audio clip as a one-shot. Note: The clip does not have to be in the list.
* **Pause()** - Pause the audio source.

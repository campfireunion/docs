# Creating a custom character

Once you have the [Flipside Creator Tools](/docs/1.0/creator-tools) installed and set up,
here are the steps to create a custom character for your Flipside shows.

## Creating your character model

Characters in Flipside are 3D models with humanoid rigs (skeletal structures). These can
be made in character creation tools like [Adobe Fuse](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/fuse.html)
and [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/), or in any 3D modelling program such as
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or [Maya](https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/maya/overview).

## Importing the character into Flipside

1. Import your character model as an FBX by dragging the FBX file into your Unity project's **Project** pane.
2. Select the character model in Unity's **Project** pane, and click on the **Rig** tab in the **Inspector** pane.
3. In the **Animation Type** selection, choose **Humanoid** then click **Apply**.
4. With your character selected in Unity's **Project** pane, go to Flipside Creator Tools > Create Character With Selected Model in the main menu.
5. Go to Window > AssetBundle Browser and select the **Build** tab. Click **Build** to generate the asset bundle for your character.
6. Log into your Flipside Creator Account at [www.flipsidexr.com/user](https://www.flipsidexr.com/user) and click on the **Characters** link.
7. Find and upload the generated asset bundle file for your character.
8. Relaunch the Flipside app to see your new character in the **Characters** palette.

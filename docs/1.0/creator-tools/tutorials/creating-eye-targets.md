# Creating eye targets

Eye targets are points of interest that characters would naturally focus on when interacting with them on a set.

Making an eye target is as easy as adding an [[Creator Tools / References / Custom Components / EyeTarget]] component to an object.

Let's go one step deeper and create a target that is only active for one second whenever the object is grabbed, to simulate taking a short interest in the object while first interacting with it, then losing interest once a character has it in their hand.

> Note: This tutorial assumes you have a set with a prop already setup. To use an existing set from the examples, open the scene **Assets/FlipsideCreatorTools/Examples/Example-Set**.

The first step is to click on your prop in the **Hierarchy** window. A prop is any object which has a [[Creator Tools / References / Custom Components / PropElement]] component attached to it.

> If you're using the Example-Set, you can find a prop in the hierarchy at **Example-Set/Contents/Prop station/Props/Prop-default**.

With the prop selected, scroll to the bottom of the **Inspector** window and click the **Add Component** button.

Start typing **EyeTarget** into the search box until you see the **EyeTarget** component, then select it to add it to your prop.

At this point, you have just created a prop that is also an eye target.

Next, to make it only a target of interest when it's first grabbed, uncheck the **Register On Start** checkbox so it doesn't become active automatically when the set loads, then on the **PropElement** component, click the **+** icon under the **OnBeginInteraction** event handler list.

Drag the **EyeTarget** component into the empty component slot that was created under **OnBeginInteraction**.

Lastly, click on the dropdown that says **No Function** and choose **EyeTarget.RegisterForTime (float)**. Set the value from **0** to **1** to tell it to become an active eye target for one second every time the prop is grabbed.

You're now ready to save your scene and rebuild your set bundle for use in Flipside.

See the [[Creator Tools / References / Custom Components / EyeTarget]] references for information about each of the **EyeTarget** component's settings and capabilities.

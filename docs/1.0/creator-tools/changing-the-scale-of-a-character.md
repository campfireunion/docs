# Changing the scale of a character

To change the scale of a character, select the 3D model in the **Project** window in Unity so you can see its import settings in the **Inspector** window.

Under the [Model tab](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FBXImporter-Model.html), find the **Scale Factor** field and adjust the value to your desired scale for the character in meters.

When you have the scale you want for your character, click **Apply** to apply the scale. Your character should now be the correct scale when you set it up for importing into Flipside Studio.

> Note: Don't change the scale of a character in the **Hierarchy** window. Instead, follow the steps above to set its scale. Otherwise, this will cause problems with some features in Flipside Studio.

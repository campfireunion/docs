Choose the video camera from the Show Tools category on the Build palette to add a camera to your set.  You can place up to eight cameras to get a variety of angles of your recording.  There is a display attached to the side of the camera that will let you see your framing. See [[Recording a show]].

> **Important Note:** Your cameras will not show up in your recording.  If you want them to, see [Recording the Flipside User Interface](/docs/1.0/tips-and-tricks#recording-the-flipside-user-interface).

## Preview monitors

Preview monitors let you know what the active camera is seeing while you’re recording your show.  Place preview monitors around your set so you can always have a reference of the framing and camera angle while you’re acting.

> **Important Note:** Your preview monitors will not show up in your recording. If you want them to, see [Recording the Flipside User Interface](/docs/1.0/tips-and-tricks#recording-the-flipside-user-interface).

In order to track your full body, Flipside uses HTC's [Vive Trackers](https://www.vive.com/us/vive-tracker).
These are used to provide additional tracking points for your feet and hips.

The following configurations are supported:

* 2 Vive Trackers: Feet
* 3 Vive Trackers: Feet and hips

To use the trackers, you will need to strap or clip them to your feet and hips.
We recommend the [Rebuff Reality Trackstrap](https://rebuffreality.com/products/trackstrap)
for foot straps.

## Using the trackers

Once you have your Vive Trackers paired to your Vive system, turn them on and attach them
to your body. You should see a green light on each tracker when it is ready.

Next, Launch Flipside and select the [[Characters]] palette. Grab the palette and turn it
upside down. Press the **Connect Trackers** button on the underside of the palette and
follow the calibration instructions.

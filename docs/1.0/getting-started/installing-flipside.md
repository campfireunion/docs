Once you launch Flipside, you will be prompted to enter your email.  This will create a creator account for you on the Flipside website ([www.flipsidexr.com](https://www.flipsidexr.com/)) and send you a verification email.

Your Flipside creator account lets you upload custom props and other functionality, and also access the Flipside Creator Community.

Flipside lets you save and come back to different configurations of any given set, called setups:

**Step 1.** Choose a set and add a few props to it.

**Step 4.** Make some changes to the set by adding, removing, or repositioning props, or changing the sky.

**Step 5.** Click on **Save As New Setup** again to save a second configuration of your set.  

If you want to update an existing setup, select that setup, make your changes, then click on **Update Setup**.

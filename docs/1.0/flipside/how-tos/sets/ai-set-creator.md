# AI Set Creator (beta)

Create instant backdrops for your shots with the AI Set Creator.

>**Beta disclaimer:** The AI Set Creator is currently in beta and may include bugs that could potentially result in crashes or data loss. Use it at your own risk. AI-generated sets are different from ordinary sets in Flipside. AI-generated sets are panoramic 360 images which don't always line up with your floor height or sense of scale (yet). 

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Sets** from the main menu and go to the **Imported** category.

**Step 2.** Click on **AI Set Creator**.

This will bring up a pop-up where you can enter in all the details for the set you want.

Your set will take a few moments to generate, but once ready it will automatically load and you can find it the **Imported** category of the **Sets** menu.

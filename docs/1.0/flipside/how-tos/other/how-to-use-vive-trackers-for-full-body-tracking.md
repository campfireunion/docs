# How to use Vive trackers for full body tracking

:omit-from-search

> Note: Vive trackers are only supported in the SteamVR version of Flipside.

Flipside supports [Vive trackers](https://www.vive.com/us/vive-tracker) for tracking your feet and waist. For this how-to you'll need a set of Vive trackers as well as straps or clips to attach them to your clothes. We recommend the [Rebuff Reality TrackStrap bundle](https://rebuffreality.com/).

## Wearing the trackers

Foot trackers should be worn on the tops of your feet, and should fit reasonably snugly to avoid shaking when you take steps.

The waist tracker should be clipped to your belt or pants, either on the front or back, and in the middle of your body.

## Mapping the trackers

Once you've [paired your trackers to your PC](https://www.vive.com/us/support/tracker3/category_howto/pairing-vive-tracker.html), here's how to assign them to each body part:

**Step 1.** Launch SteamVR with your headset off.

**Step 2.** Turn on your trackers.

**Step 3.** In the SteamVR window, click on the hamburger menu in the top left, hover over **Devices**, then click on **Manage Vive Trackers**.

**Step 4.** In the window that opens, click **Manage Vive Trackers** again to see a list of your tracking devices.

**Step 5.** Use the dropdown to the right of each tracker to assign it to the **Left Foot**, **Right Foot**, or **Waist**.

> Tip: To identify which tracker is which, you can try turning them off and on again one at a time. It may also be useful to label the trackers themselves so you can keep track of which one is mapped to each body part.

## Using the trackers

**Step 1.** Put on your trackers and turn them on.

**Step 2.** Take your headset off and look at Flipside's user switcher interface on your desktop.

**Step 3.** Click on the settings icon along the bottom of the screen. It looks like a little gear icon.

**Step 4.** Click on the **Input** tab.

**Step 5.** Click **Connect Trackers** to start tracking.

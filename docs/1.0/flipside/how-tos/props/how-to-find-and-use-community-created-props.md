# How to find and use community-created props

:omit-from-search

Here's how to find and use props that other community members have made and shared:

**Step 1.** Visit [flipsidecommunity.com](https://www.flipsidecommunity.com/share?type=prop) and find a prop kit you'd like to use.

**Step 2.** Click on the green **Install** icon to install the prop kit into your account. This will redirect you to the flipsidexr.com website in a new tab.

**Step 3.** If you're not already logged into the flipsidexr.com website as a creator, enter your login info next.

You should now see a notice that the new prop kit has been added to your account. You can safely close the browser tab.

**Step 4.** Launch Flipside and go to **Props > All Props > Imported** to find your newly-imported prop kit. Click on any of the props from the kit to load them up.

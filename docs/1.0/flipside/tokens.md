# Flipside tokens

Tokens are the virtual currency of Flipside. They provide a way to pay for virtual goods or premium features, but more importantly, they provide a way for creators to generate revenue from their Flipside content.

Our mission is to help creators build sustainable channels where they can earn real money from their content. That's why we're introducing creator payouts from day 1 in our token system. When you reach the payout threshold, visit the [Flipside Creator Portal](/user) and click on the **Request Payout** button. It's that easy.

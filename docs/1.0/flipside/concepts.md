# Concepts

Flipside is a metaverse social media platform with a built-in virtual TV/film studio where users can produce live or recorded animated shows together.

Flipside turns off-the-shelf VR hardware into a motion capture system where actors can control characters by embodying them with their own movements and voice, automatically lip syncing as actors speak and automatically moving in unison with theis movements.

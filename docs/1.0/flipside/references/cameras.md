# Cameras

--- Platform: Quest ---

Flipside's camera system has the following options.

## Camera options

Each camera has the following features:

- **Focal length** - Adjust the focal length of the camera.
- **Horizontal lock** - Lock the camera's rotation to the horizon.
- **Photo** - Switch to photo mode to take still images.
- **Flip** - Flip the direction the camera is facing.

## Camera settings

The following camera settings can be adjusted by going to the **Settings** tab on the **Dashboard**:

- **Lock cameras** - If enabled, it will prevent the local user from interacting with cameras on a set. Useful for actors when collaborating with a camera operator.
- **Disable raycast grab** - If enabled, you will only be able to move a camera by grabbing it with your controller directly, but you'll still be able to interact with cameras otherwise.
- **Cameras are eye targets** - If enabled, characters will look directly at cameras.
- **Camera movement speed (m/s)** - How fast the camera should move between positions when the camera switcher is set to **Move**.
- **Camera shake** - Whether to apply a shake to cameras so they have a more handheld human feel, and if so, how much.

- **Cut** - When enabled, selecting cameras will cut instantly to them.
- **Move** - When enabled, selecting cameras will move smoothly from the old position to the new one.

# Creator tools

The Flipside Creator Tools are an extension for the Unity game engine that enable creators to create custom characters and sets for their Flipside shows.

## Download

> **Note:** The Flipside Creator Tools requires a specific version of Unity in order for the exported character and set bundles to work properly, which you can always find on our [[>Installation and setup]] page.

Latest version:

**[Flipside Creator Tools v0.13](/files/downloads/FlipsideCreatorTools-v0.13.unitypackage)**

Beta version (use this version if you opted into the Flipside Studio beta):

* **[Flipside Creator Tools v0.19](/files/downloads/FlipsideCreatorTools-v0.19.unitypackage)**
* **[Flipside Creator Tools v0.19 + Examples](/files/downloads/FlipsideCreatorTools+Examples-v0.19.unitypackage)**

The Examples package includes additional examples and documentation to help you get started with the Creator Tools, which you'll find under the `FlipsideCreatorTools/Examples` and `FlipsideCreatorTools/Documentation` folders in Unity once you've imported the package. Double click the example Unity scenes to open them and see how things are set up.

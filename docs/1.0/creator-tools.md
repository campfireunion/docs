# Flipside Creator Tools

The Flipside Creator Tools are an extension for the Unity game engine that enable creators to create custom characters and sets for their Flipside shows.

Characters support the ability to animate faces using any combination of blend shapes, Unity animations, jaw bones, or texture swapping that work seamlessly with the Flipside Studio facial expression engine which controls blinking, eye movement, facial expressions, and lip syncing along as you speak.

Sets support the ability to build a wide variety of interactive elements, as well as the ability to test those interactions in VR just by hitting Play in Unity. These can be as simple as grabbable props, or as complicated as complete games.

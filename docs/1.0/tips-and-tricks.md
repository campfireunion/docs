# Tips and tricks

## Recording the Flipside user interface

If you want to record the Flipside user interface elements (ie. cameras, preview monitors, palettes, menus, and teleprompter), **press Alt + V** to show or hide.

## Going fullscreen

To show or hide the camera switcher interface on the second screen output, **press Alt + S**.

## Director mode

To switch yourself into director mode, which lets you move and scale the scene like you can in the [Set Builder](/docs/1.0/building-your-set/dressing-your-set), **press Alt + D**. Press it again to leave director mode.

Director mode also makes you invisible to the cameras and motion capture recordings.

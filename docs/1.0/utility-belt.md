# Utility belt

If you look down at your waist in Flipside, you'll see a utility belt with commonly used tools.

On the right, you'll see a holster with a camera attached. This enables you to quickly grab the
handheld camera and begin filming, or capture a photo or selfie to share on social media.

On the left, you'll see a holster with a puppet attached. This lets you control your character
in puppet mode, where your hand becomes the character, enabling you to walk around a larger
area than your VR tracking space.

## Camera

When you grab the camera from your right holster, it will open the handheld camera for
you to use to capture footage and photos in Flipside.

For more info, see the [[Handheld camera]] page.

## Puppeteering

When you grab the puppet from your left holster, you can use it to enter puppet mode.
Squeeze the **index trigger** to enter puppet mode, and **release it** to exit puppet mode.
When you exit puppet mode, you will immediately jump back into first-person perspective
and control of your character.

Let go of the puppet and it will disappear, but you can always grab it again from your
left holster.

While puppeteering, your puppet hand controls the position of your character. Your head and
free hand continue to control your character's head and other hand as usual, and your lip
syncing and facial expressions continue to work as expected too.

You can use your puppetting hand to jump or move around, and the feet will try to mimic
walking as you move your character around the set.

You can also pick up and use props while puppeteering, and any props held in your free hand
should continue to be held by the puppet and back to your full-body character after you
leave puppet mode too.

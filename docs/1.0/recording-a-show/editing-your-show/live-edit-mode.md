# Live Edit mode

> **Important note:** Before you can use the Live Edit mode, make sure that OBS Studio is set up. See [[:Setting up OBS Studio]].

There are two ways to live edit in Flipside, using the camera switcher that appears on your computer screen or using the in-VR camera switcher.

Flipside will default to using the camera switcher that appears on your computer screen.  If you want to use the in-VR camera switcher instead, press **Alt + S**.  This will hide the switcher interface on your computer screen allowing you to capture your show at full screen and launches the in-VR camera switcher.

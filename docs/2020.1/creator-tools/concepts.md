# Concepts

Flipside Creator Tools is a plugin for the Unity game engine that enables creators to create custom characters and sets for their shows in Flipside Studio.

We try to make it as easy as possible so you don't need to understand programming, 3D modelling, or animation in order to use the Flipside Creator Tools, but there are still many aspects of creating 3D scenes where technical knowledge of lighting, sound design, etc. are advantageous, and Unity is a complex piece of software that we can only hide so much.

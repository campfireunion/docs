# Flipside Creator Tools concepts

The Flipside Creator Tools are an extension for the Unity game engine that enables creators to create custom characters and sets for their shows in Flipside Studio.

We try to make it as easy as possible so you don't need to understand programming, 3D modelling, or animation in order to use them, but there are still many aspects of creating 3D scenes where technical knowledge of lighting, sound design, etc. are advantageous, and Unity is a complex piece of software unto itself that we can only hide so much.

## Character importer

Characters support the ability to animate faces using any combination of blend shapes, Unity animations, jaw bones, or texture swapping that work seamlessly with the Flipside Studio facial expression engine which controls blinking, eye movement, facial expressions, and lip syncing along as you speak.

## Set importer

Sets support the ability to build a wide variety of interactive elements, as well as the ability to test those interactions in VR just by hitting Play in Unity. These can be as simple as grabbable props, or as complicated as complete games.

# Saving your setups

Once you've finished dressing your set and setting up your cameras, you can save a snapshot of your setup
that you can go back to at any time.

A saved setup consists of:

* The set
* The sky
* Prop placements
* Actor marks
* Camera placements
* Slideshows, teleprompters, and other show tools

## How to save your setup

Press the **Save Setup** button found on the underside of the **Sets** or **Set Builder** palette. Flipside will
confirm that you want to save your current setup. When it's done saving your setup, Flipside will let you
know the name of your new setup.

## Finding and loading a saved setup

To go back to a saved setup, go to the **My Sets** category on the **Sets** palette. Saved setups will appear
with reversed colours and the setup name and date under the original set name.

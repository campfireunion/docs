# Live Edit mode

> **Important note:** Before you can use the Live Edit mode, make sure that OBS Studio is set up. See [[:Setting up OBS Studio]].

There are two ways to live edit in Flipside, using the camera switcher that appears on your computer screen or using the in-VR camera switcher.

Flipside will default to using the camera switcher that appears on your computer screen. If you want to use the in-VR camera switcher instead, **Alt + F** to go fullscreen then find the in-VR camera switcher in the **Show Tools** prop category.

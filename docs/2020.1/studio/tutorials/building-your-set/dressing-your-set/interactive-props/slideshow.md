# Slideshow

The slideshow props let you add and control a slideshow on your set.  You can set which images or videos are shown on the slideshow by pasting a list of image and video links in your [Flipside creator dashboard](/user), or under the Settings button in the [desktop camera switcher](https://www.flipsidexr.com/docs/2020.1/recording-a-show/editing-your-show/cutting-cameras).

The slideshow prop is found in the Show Tools category in the Set Builder.

**To add images or videos to the slideshow, follow these steps:**

1. Log in to the Flipside website to access your creator profile.
2. Click on the **Slideshow** link.  This will bring you to the page where you can add the links to the images/videos you want in your slideshow.
3. Paste the links for your images/videos in the text field.  Make sure to start each link on itâ€™s own line.
4. Press the **Save** button.  Now your images/videos will be loaded when you add a slideshow to your set in Flipside.

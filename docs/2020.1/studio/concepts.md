# Concepts

Flipside Studio is a virtual TV or film studio where users can produce live or recorded animated shows together. It uses VR hardware as a motion capture system where actors can control characters by embodying them with their own movements and voice, automatically lip syncing as the actor speaks and automatically moving in unison with the actor's movements.

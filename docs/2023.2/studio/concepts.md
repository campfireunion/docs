Flipside Studio is animation software that acts as a virtual TV/film studio where users can produce live or recorded animated shows together.

Flipside Studio turns off-the-shelf VR hardware into a motion capture system where actors can control characters by embodying them with their own movements and voice, automatically lip syncing as actors speak and automatically moving in unison with theis movements.

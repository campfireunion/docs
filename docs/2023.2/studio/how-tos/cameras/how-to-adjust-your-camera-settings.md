# How to adjust your camera settings

In addition to the individual camera settings found on the cameras themselves, Flipside Studio includes a few additional camera settings found under the **Settings** tab of the **Dashboard**.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Dashboard** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Click on the **Settings** tab in the leftmost column of the dashboard.

You'll see the following camera settings in the **Cameras** section of the settings tab:

- **Lock cameras** - If enabled, you won't be able to interact with cameras on set. Use this to avoid actors accidentally interacting with cameras during a show.
- **Disable raycast grab** - If enabled, you'll only be able to move a camera by grabbing it with the controller directly.
- **Cameras are eye targets** - If enabled, characters will look directly at cameras.
- **Movement speed (m/s)** - The speed the camera travels when moving from position to position.
- **Camera shake** - Applies a natural shake to cameras to simulate a handheld feel. Set it to zero to disable camera shake.

**Step 3.** Try adjusting some of these settings then interact with the cameras and camera switcher to see how their behaviour changes.

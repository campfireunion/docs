# How to draw your own props with the Magic Pencil

The Magic Pencil is a special prop in Flipside Studio that lets you draw in 3D. Your drawings become props you can grab and interact with.

**Step 1.** Open the **Props** menu and got to the **All Props > Decor** category.

**Step 2.** Find and add the **Magic Pencil** prop to your set.

**Step 3.** Close the Props menu.

**Step 4.** Grab the Magic Pencil prop then, while holding it, use your joystick to change the colour that you're drawing with.

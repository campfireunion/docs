# How to change properties of a prop (gravity, etc)

Turn gravity on or off, lock, clone or delete a prop through the Prop Properties menu. 

**Step 1.** Place one of your controllers in the prop and press the menu button on that controller. This button will now open the prop properties menu instead of the main menu.

Click on the checkbox next to **gravity** to set whether the prop should be affected by gravity or float in place.

Click on the checkbox next to **lock** to lock the prop so it can’t move.  Locked props will remain in place until unlocked. When locked, you won’t be able to grab the prop and it will not react to its gravity setting.

Click **clone** to duplicate the prop or **delete** to remove a prop.

# How to use sets

Flipside Studio lets you load virtual sets to make shows on, including letting you save different setups or configurations of each set. Here's how to find and load sets:

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Sets** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Choose a set you like from the list and click on it to load that set. Take some time to teleport around and explore the set.

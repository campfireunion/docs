# How to export audio data

Here's how you can export audio data from Flipside Studio:

**Step 1.** Select and load the recording in the **Recordings** menu for the audio you want to export.

**Step 2.** Take your headset off and look at Flipside Studio's user switcher interface on your desktop.

**Step 3.** Click on the button with the recording's name (along the bottom of the desktop switcher interface). This will bring up the **Take Editor** menu.

**Step 4.** Click **Export All Audio** to export your recording's audio data. Each actor's voice will be exported as a separate audio file so you can mix them individually during editing.

**Step 5.** Click **Open Export Folder** to be taken to your exported WAV files.

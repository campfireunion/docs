> **Tip:** You can let go of the joystick without pressing the index finger trigger to close the teleporter and cancel a teleport. This is different from many other VR apps, and gives you more control over where you'll end up.

**Step 5.** If there is a seat, actor mark, or stand-in in your set, aim the teleporter at it until it snaps to that position then teleport to jump directly to that spot.

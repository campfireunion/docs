# Microphone settings

You can find the microphone settings by clicking on the gear icon on the [[studio / references / desktop interface]] and clicking on the **Microphone** tab.

This is what the microphone settings looks like:

Microphone settings include:

* **Microphone Input Device** - Lets you choose which microphone input device Flipside Studio is using.
* **Lip-Sync Gain** - A volume multiplier to apply to the microphone input before sending it for lip-sync analysis.
* **Lip-Sync Noise Gate** - Eliminates background noise below a certain threshold to prevent external noises from affecting the lip-syncing.
* **Compression** - Whether compression is enabled on the voice input. If enabled, compression can be applied to the lip-sync, recorded voice, or both.

### Compression settings

* **Attack Time** - This is the time it takes for the audio signal to become fully compressed after exceeding the threshold level.
* **Threshold** - This sets the input level above which compression is applied.
* **Compression Ratio** - This sets the amount of attenuation applied to the input data. For example, a ratio of 1:1 will apply no attenuation, while 2:1 will attenuate a signal that is 2 dB above the threshold down to 1 dB above.
* **Gain** - Since attenuation lowers the output volume of a signal, the output gain can be used to make up for the attenuation and bring the volume back up to where you want it.

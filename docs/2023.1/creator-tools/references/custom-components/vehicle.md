# Vehicle

**Experimental.** Enables an object to behave as a vehicle, causing users who teleport into chairs or teleport targets inside the vehicle to move with it.

You can choose whether users should rotate with the vehicle's rotation, and it currently offers two methods that can be connected to Unity events:

* **EnterVehicle()** - Cause the user to enter the vehicle.
* **ExitVehicle()** - Cause the user to exit the vehicle.

# GroupChoiceElement

Group choices let you put something to a vote amongst the users present in the scene. This enables a choose-your-own-adventure style interaction where the group decides what happens next based on a predetermined set of choices.

The example scene `FlipsideCreatorTools/Examples/Example-GroupChoice` shows how a group choice can be set up. To add it to your sets, drag the `GroupChoiceElement` prefab from `FlipsideCreatorTools/Resources` and customize the options and associated events as needed.

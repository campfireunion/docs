# PhysicsEstimator

Provides physics estimation when attached to an object, with the ability to trigger physics taking over for the object's movement and applying the correct velocity and angular velocity by calling the **ReleaseObject()** method.

Note: If the object's movement is controlled by an animation, disable the animator first before calling **ReleaseObject()**.

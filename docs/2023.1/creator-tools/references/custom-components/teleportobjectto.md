# TeleportObjectTo

Provides the ability to teleport an object to a specified position, set in the **Teleport Position** property. Teleports itself by default, but can optionally teleport a different object if one is specified in the **Object To Move** property.

Teleportation is triggered via the **Teleport()** method, which can be triggered by any event in the scene.

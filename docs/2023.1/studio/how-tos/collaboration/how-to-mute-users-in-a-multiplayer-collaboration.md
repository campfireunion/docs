# How to mute users in a multiplayer collaboration

There are times in a collaboration where you might not want everyone's voice to be heard, such as if they're not present in the current scene. Here's how to mute and unmute users in a collaboration.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Multiplayer** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** In the **Collaboration** section along the top, click on the dropdown menu for the user you want to mute.

**Step 3.** Choose **Mute** from the dropdown options.

**Step 4.** Choose **Unmute** from the dropdown options to unmute the user.

> **Note**: If you mute yourself, it will mute you to everyone else in the multiplayer session. If you mute someone else, it will only mute them for you but not for everyone else.

# How to share scripts with your project team

In addition to sharing recordings, characters and sets, you can also share scripts with the project team that can be loaded into the teleprompter.

**Step 1.** Visit [www.flipsidexr.com/user](https://www.flipsidexr.com/user) and log in using your Flipside creator login info.

**Step 2.** Click on the **Projects** tab.

**Step 3.** Find your project in the list and click on the **Scripts** link.

**Step 4.** Click on the **Add Script** link.

**Step 5.** Enter a name for your script under the **Script name** field.

**Step 6.** Enter your script into the script field then click **Save Changes**.

Repeat steps 4-6 to add additional scripts to your project.

When you reload Flipside Studio, your newly-added scripts will appear in the teleprompter list when you have the same project open in-app. For more info, see [[studio / how tos / show tools / how to use the teleprompter]].

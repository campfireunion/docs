# How to move and scale a set

Now that you know [[:how to use sets]], let's explore how to move around them.

For actors while in character, the ways to move around are either to walk around within your tracking space, or teleport to other places in the set then walk around from there. When you make yourself invisible, you gain the ability to move by manipulating the set itself.

**Step 1.** Make sure you're invisible by pressing the menu button on either controller and making sure the **Visibility** button is highlighted green. Click the button to toggle it if it's not highlighted green.

> Tip: When the Props menu is open, you'll automatically become invisible since this puts the set into a "build mode" for manipulating props.

**Step 2.** To change the scale of the set, press and hold the grab button on both controllers then move your hands closer together. This is how you can shrink or expand the set down around you.

> Tip: You can get back to 1:1 scale at any time by teleporting anywhere on the set.

**Step 3.** Continuing to grab the set, rotate your hands around each other in a circular motion parallel to the floor. This is how you can rotate the set.

**Step 4.** Let go of the grip with one hand and continue moving the other around. Grabbing it with one hand at a time is how you can move the set.

**Step 5.** Try alternating hands to pull the set towards you in a continuous motion. This is one way you can get around a set while invisible.

**Step 6.** Grab a camera from the main menu and try holding the camera with one hand and moving the set with the other. This is a powerful way to control camera movements as a camera operator in Flipside Studio.

> Tip: To quickly travel larger distances on a set, teleporting is often the quickest way, but next to that is shrinking the set way down then pulling the part of the set you're trying to get to towards you.

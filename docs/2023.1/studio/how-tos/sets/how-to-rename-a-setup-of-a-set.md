# How to rename a setup of a set

Once you've created a saved setup (see: [[: how to save multiple setups of a set]]), you might want to rename it to something you'll easily recognize later:

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Sets** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Find your set in the menu.

**Step 3.** Click on the dropdown menu at the bottom of the set listing and choose **Setups**. This lists all of the available setups for a given set.

**Step 4.** Click on the **Rename** icon next to the setup you'd like to rename.

**Step 5.** Edit the name using the keyboard that pops up, then click **Confirm** when you're done entering the new name.

Your setup will be renamed moving forward.

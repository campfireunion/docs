# How to connect an external microphone

> **Note:** Due to limitations of the Quest, external microphones are only supported on the desktop version of Flipside Studio.

**Step 1.** Take your headset off and look at Flipside Studio's user switcher interface on your desktop.

**Step 2.** Click on the settings icon along the bottom of the screen. It looks like a little gear icon.

**Step 3.** Click on the **Microphone** tab.

**Step 4.** Click on the **Microphone Input Device** dropdown and choose your external microphone from the list. Talk through your microphone and watch the volume meter on your desktop to verify that you've chosen the right input device.

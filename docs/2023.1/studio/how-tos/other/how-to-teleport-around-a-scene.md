# How to teleport around a scene

Here's how to teleport around your sets in Flipside Studio.

**Step 1.** Press your right hand joystick in any direction to open the teleporter.

**Step 2.** Aim the teleporter indicator where you'd like to end up.

**Step 3.** Choose which direction you'd like to be facing by rotating the joystick until the arrow points where you'd like.

**Step 4.** To teleport, press the index finger trigger on your right hand controller.

**Step 5.** Aim the teleporter at any seat, actor mark, or stand-in until it snaps to that position then teleport to jump directly to that spot.

> Tip: You can let go of the joystick without pressing the index finger trigger to close the teleporter and cancel a teleport. This is different from many other VR apps, and gives you more control over where you'll end up.

# How to use hand tracking

> **Note**: Hand tracking support is a Quest-only feature, however the Valve Index controllers also support basic finger tracking as well.

Here's how to use hand tracking in Flipside Studio:

**Step 1.** Enable hand tracking on your Quest by going to **Settings** then **Hands and Controllers** in the Quest menu.

**Step 2.** Make sure **Hand Tracking** is checked.

**Step 3.** Launch Flipside Studio with your controllers put away. Your hands will be tracked automatically.

**Step 4.** To open the main menu, look a the palm of your left hand. You'll see the main menu icon appear. Pinch your index finger and thumb together to open it.  

**Step 5.** To click an option in the menus, hover over the button your want to press and make a short pinch with your index finger and thumb to select it.

**Step 6.** To open the Quest menu, look a the palm of your right hand. You'll see the Quest menu icon appear. Pinch your index finger and thumb together to open it.  

> **Tip**: Some features such as teleporting aren't supported through hand tracking, but you can switch between using hand tracking and using controllers by picking up your controllers and putting them down again.

The dashboard appears in front of you each time Flipside Studio loads, providing quick access to a number of useful items:

- Settings tab

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Dashboard** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Close the dashboard when you're done with it by clicking on the **X** button in the top right corner.

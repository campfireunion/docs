# How to use the slideshow

Slideshows provide a way to bring a sequence of photos and videos into Flipside Studio that can be displayed anywhere in a set.

> Note: To customize your list of slides, [log into your creator account on flipsidexr.com](flipsidexr.com/user) then go to **Projects** and click on the **Slides** link for the project you wish to add them to. Slides belong to a project so they can be shared with the whole project team.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Props** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Go to **All Props** and choose the **Show Tools** category.

**Step 3.** Find the **Slideshow** prop in the show tools listings and click on it to add it to your set.

**Step 4.** Place the slideshow where you want it to appear on set.

**Step 5.** Reopen the **Props** menu and find the **Slideshow Controller** prop which is also in the **Show Tools** category. Click it to add it to your set as well.

The slideshow controller lets you control the slideshow, while the regular slideshow prop lets you control where the slideshow appears on your set. You can place as many slideshow props on your set as you need.

> Tip: You can use a slideshow controller without a visible slideshow in your set to play background audio tracks in your scenes.

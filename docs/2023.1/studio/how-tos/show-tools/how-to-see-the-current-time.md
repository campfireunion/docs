# How to see the current time

Sometimes we lose track of time in VR, so Flipside Studio provides a prop you can use to see the current time.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Props** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Choose **All Props** then go to the **Show Tools** category.

**Step 3.** Click on the **Current Time** prop in the list to add it to your set.

**Step 4.** Place the current time prop wherever you'd like to be able to see it.

The time will be visible only to actors but not visible to cameras unless you enable **Show UI** on the camera switcher.

# How to add parts to an existing motion capture recording

Here's how to add additional parts to an existing motion capture recording that you've made.

**Step 1.** [Load the recording](/docs/2023.1/studio/how-tos/how-to-watch-a-motion-capture-recording) in the **Recordings** menu.

**Step 2.** Click the **Add New Part** button along the bottom of the menu.
A countdown will begin and then Flipside Studio will start recording.

**Step 3.** Perform your scene. Note that if you have multiple users connected over multiplayer, any user who is in character will be added as a new part at the same time.
**Step 4.** When you're done your scene, open the main menu again and choose **Stop Recording**.

The **Recordings** menu will appear, asking you whether you want to keep or discard the recording you just made.

**Step 5.** Choose **Keep Take** to save the recording.
You'll see the new recording take a few seconds to save, which also backs it up to the cloud.

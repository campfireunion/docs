# How to watch a motion capture recording

Once you've [recorded a motion capture recording in Flipside Studio](/docs/2022.1/studio/how-tos/how-to-make-a-motion-capture-recording), you can play it back using the following steps.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Recordings** from the main menu.

This will open the **Recordings** menu with a list of the recordings in the currently opened project.

**Step 2.** Click on the recording you want to load and watch.

Once the recording has been loaded, you will see the menu change to display a list of acted parts in the recording.

**Step 3.** Click the **Play** icon.

The recording should begin playing momentarily. From here you can also pause, rewind or stop the recording.

**Step 4.** To unload a recording when you're done watching it, click **Unload Current Recording** on the bottom of the **Recordings** menu.

You can also find this information in Flipside Studio's in-app **Help** menu.

# How to make a motion capture recording

Flipside Studio can record full motion and scene capture, including voices and interactions with props in the scene. It can capture up to 10 actors at a time, and you can record additional parts on top of existing recordings too.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Record** from the main menu.

A countdown will begin and then Flipside Studio will start recording.

**Step 2.** Perform your scene.

**Step 3.** When you're done your scene, open the main menu again and choose **Stop Recording**.

The **Recordings** menu will appear, asking you whether you want to keep or discard the recording you just made.

**Step 4.** Choose **Keep Take** to save the recording.

You'll see the recording take a few seconds to save, which also backs it up to the cloud.

You can also find this information in Flipside Studio's in-app **Help** menu.

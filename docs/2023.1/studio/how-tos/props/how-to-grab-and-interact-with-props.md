# How to grab and interact with props

There are two ways of interacting with a prop:

## 1. Grabbing and moving them around

**Step 1.** Add a regular prop to your set (see: [[:how to add props to a set]]).

**Step 2.** Close the Props menu.

**Step 3.** Reach out for a prop with one of your controllers until the prop highlights that you're within range.

**Step 4.** Press and hold your grab button to grab the prop and move it around with your hand.

## 2. Triggering prop effects

Some props have special effects that happen when you press your index finger trigger while holding them.

**Step 1.** Open the **Props** menu and got to the **All Props > Decor** category.

**Step 2.** Find and add the **Magic Pencil** prop to your set.

**Step 3.** Close the Props menu.

**Step 4.** Grab the Magic Pencil prop then, while holding it, press your index finger trigger to begin drawing.

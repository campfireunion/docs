# How to change properties of a prop (gravity, etc)

Once you've added a few props to your set, here's how to change the properties of their behaviour.

**Step 1.** Make sure the **Props** menu is open. When this menu is open, props can be modified instead of interacting with their regular behaviours.

**Step 2.** Grab the prop with one of your controllers and press the menu button on that controller while holding it. When you're holding a prop, this button opens the prop properties menu instead of the main menu.

**Step 3.** Click on the checkbox next to any of the properties to change that behaviour. Options include:

- **Movable** - Whether the prop can be grabbed and moved or it should stay in place.
- **Gravity** - Whether the prop should be affected by gravity or not.
- **Respawn** - Whether the prop should automatically respawn new copies of itself at its original position when you grab it.

**Step 4.** Close the Properties menu and the Props menu to see the prop's behaviours change.

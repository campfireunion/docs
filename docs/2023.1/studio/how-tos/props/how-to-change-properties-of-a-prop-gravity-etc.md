# How to change properties of a prop (gravity, etc)

Once you've added a few props to your set, here's how to select if it's affected by gravity.

**Step 1.** Grab the prop with one of your controllers and press the menu button on that controller while holding it. When you're holding a prop, this button opens the prop properties menu instead of the main menu.

# Recording your POV with the Meta Quest recording feature

You can capture video of what you see in Flipside Studio using Meta Quest’s recording feature. Although this method is limited to your point of view, it’s a great option if you want to record video of your content directly onto your device.

>**Note**: Since Meta Quest’s recording feature captures what you see, it does not work with Flipside Studio’s camera switcher.

You are the camera when you use Meta Quest’s recording feature. You can show your audience what you see or watch a recording you’ve made and capture it as if you are a camera.

**Step 1.** Once you’re ready to start capturing video, press the **Meta Quest menu** button on your **right controller** to pull up **Meta Quest’s universal menu**.

**Step 2.** Click on the **Record Video** button.

To include audio, select the toggle next to **Include Mic Audio**.

**Step 3.** When you’re ready to record, select **Start Recording**.

**Step 4.** When you’re finished, press the **menu button** on your **right controller** to pull up **Meta Quest’s universal menu**.

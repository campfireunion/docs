# Installing Flipside Studio

## Download

Flipside Studio can be installed through the [Meta Quest store](https://ocul.us/3VjQ3NM) or [Meta Rift store](https://ocul.us/3AAw5Xm).

## Account

Once you launch Flipside Studio, you'll be prompted to enter your email. This will create an account for you on the [Flipside XR website](https://www.flipsidexr.com/) and send you a verification email.

Your Flipside account lets you upload custom characters, sets, teleprompter scripts and more.  It also lets you download the Flipside Creator Tools to integrate your own charaters, sets and props and the Flipside Broadcaster which allows you to cast your content to a PC.

## Flipside Broadcaster

The Flipside Broadcaster is a free companion app that lets you cast your show to a PC.  If you're using Meta Quest, this is how you get your camera output to a PC so you can screencapture or livestream your content. If you're using Meta Rift, you can also use Flipside Studio's Desktop Interface for additional functionality.

To use the Flipside Broadcaster, you'll need a laptop or desktop Windows PC with the following min specs:
* Intel 7th Gen CPU (Intel Core i7-7820HK @ 2.90GHz or better) OR  AMD Ryzen 7 3700U or Better
* Nvidia 1050 Mobile GPU or better OR AMD Radeon RX 570 or better
* 8GB RAM

## Third party tools

#### Open Broadcaster Software

Flipside Studio uses [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/download) to capture video output, including live streaming to YouTube, Twitch, and others.

For more information, see [[studio / tutorials / recording / editing your show / Setting up OBS Studio]].

#### Windows Media Feature Pack

Some versions of Windows don't include all of the necessary video codecs. If you have trouble seeing video playback in the slideshow or tutorial, you may need to install the [Windows Media Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack).

# Installing Flipside Studio

## Download

Flipside Studio can be installed through the [Meta Quest store](https://ocul.us/3VjQ3NM) or [Meta Rift store](https://ocul.us/3AAw5Xm).

## Account

Once you launch Flipside Studio, you'll be prompted to enter your email. This will create an account for you on the [Flipside website](https://www.flipsidexr.com/) and send you a verification email.

Your Flipside account lets you upload custom characters, sets and other functionality.

## Third party tools

#### Open Broadcaster Software

Flipside Studio uses [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/download) to capture video output, including live streaming to YouTube, Twitch, and others.

For more information, see [[studio / tutorials / recording / editing your show / Setting up OBS Studio]].

#### Windows Media Feature Pack

Some versions of Windows don't include all of the necessary video codecs. If you have trouble seeing video playback in the slideshow or tutorial, you may need to install the [Windows Media Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack).

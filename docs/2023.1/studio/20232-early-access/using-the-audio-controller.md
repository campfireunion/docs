# Using the audio controller

The audio controller is your personal sound board in Flipside Studio. It will remember the
audio files you've added to it and their settings between sessions on a per-project basis,
so you can always jump back in where you left off last time.

From the main menu, you can find the audio controller under **Props > All Props > Show Tools** as well as under **Audio > Audio Controller** for quick access.

SCREENSHOT

Audio clips that are added to the audio controller have a number of options you can use:

- **Select** - Select one or more audio clips to start and stop in unison.
- **Mute** - Mute or unmute an audio clip. If the clip is playing at the time, playback will continue silently.
- **Loop** - Causes the audio clip's playback to loop indefinitely.
- **Play/stop** - Start or stop playing the audio clip.

There are also the following dropdown options for configuring how an audio clip should play:

- **Track** - Play as a regular audio track, such as background music or sound effects.
- **Voice** - Play the audio clip as your voice. This causes your character's mouth to move along with the recorded audio until the clip ends and control is returned to your microphone.
- **Remove** - Removes the audio clip from the audio controller.

Audio that is played through either the audio browser or audio controller while recording
will automatically play back the same when you watch the recording.

> Note: Spatialized audio sources are coming in a future update.

  Channels are public, but viewers can only access your channel through a shared post.  If you don’t publish a post, then your channel can only be viewed by you.

  <summary>**What can people do with my content if I allow remixing?**</summary>
  Anything!  By allowing remixing, you’re giving a copy of your content to any user that chooses to remix it.  They can use it as a base for their own content to capture and post to their channel. Viewers will see a link to your original post on the new post’s details screen, and can also see the remixes of your post from there as well.

  <summary>**What does early access mean?**</summary>
  Early access means that you're previewing a version of Flipside Studio that isn't publicly released.  It's a sneak peek of what we're currently working on where you get to try out new features. We want to know what you think, how to make things better, or features you might really want. Your input will help shape the version that we'll be releasing publicly in the near future.

  <summary>**What can people do with my content if I allow remixing?**</summary>
  Anything!  By allowing remixing, you’re giving a copy of your content to any user that chooses to remix it.  They can use it as a base for their own content to capture and post to their channel. Viewers will see a link to your original post on the new post’s details screen, and can also see the remixes of your post from there as well.

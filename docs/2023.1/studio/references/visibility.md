# Visibility

--- Platform: Quest ---
Ghost Mode, as we often call it, will make your character invisible so you can play director without getting in the way of the shot, or animate props by grabbing them and moving them around. Ghost Mode also gives you the ability to move the world around and scale it up or down by grabbing it with one or two hands.

To go invisible, open the main menu and choose **Visibility** while in character. Press it again to get back into the last character you were in.

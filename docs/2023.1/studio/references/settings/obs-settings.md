# OBS settings

Flipside Studio integrates with [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/download) via the [obs-websocket plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-of-obs-studio-made-easy.466/).

Here are the settings you'll want to use in OBS Studio to get the best results with Flipside Studio.

- Use **Window Capture** as the video source type.
- When adding the video source, uncheck **Capture Cursor**.
- Add two (2) audio sources, **Mic/Aux** and **Desktp Audio**, to capture your voice along with other sounds from Flipside Studio.
- Under **Advanced Audio Properties** on the **Mic/Aux** audio source, set the **Sync Offset (ms)** to 120.

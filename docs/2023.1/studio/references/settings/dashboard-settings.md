# Dashboard settings

The following settings can be accessed via the **Settings** tab of the Flipside Studio dashboard.

## Multiplayer

* **Hide name tags** - Hides name tags above characters over multiplayer.

## Audio

* **Turn off user interface sounds** - Disable user interface sounds (note: they're already automatically off while recording).

## Cameras

- **Lock cameras** - If enabled, it will prevent the local user from interacting with cameras on a set. Useful for actors when collaborating with a camera operator.
- **Disable raycast grab** - If enabled, you will only be able to move a camera by grabbing it with your controller directly, but you'll still be able to interact with cameras otherwise.
- **Cameras are eye targets** - If enabled, characters will look directly at cameras.
- **Camera movement speed (m/s)** - How fast the camera should move between positions when the camera switcher is set to **Move**.
- **Camera shake** - Whether to apply a shake to cameras so they have a more handheld human feel, and if so, how much.

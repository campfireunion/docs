# Speech-to-text

When entering in text using the keyboard you have the options of typing or using the speech-to-text function that allows you to speak what you want to enter.

**Step 1.**  With the keyboard pulled up, click on the **microphone** icon and speak the text you want to enter.  The icon will turn red when your voice is being captured.

**Step 2.**  When you are done speaking, click on the **microphone** icon again to stop capturing your voice.  Youâ€™ll notice the icon will turn from red to gray and the words you spoke will appear in the text field.

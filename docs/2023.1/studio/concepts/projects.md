# Projects

Sharing resources and working collaboratively in Flipside Studio is done through the use of shared projects. Everything you record in Flipside Studio is added to the currently-opened project, which you can use to organize your solo creations or share with others by adding them as project team members.

> Note: For users coming from an older version of Flipside Studio that didn't have projects, all of your existing recordings will automatically be moved into a default project for you.

## Project team

A project team is made up of one project owner and additional team members. The project owner cannot be removed from a project and is the only team member who is allowed to delete certain resources, but all members of a project team can add assets or recordings to the project.

## Synchronous and asynchronous workflows

Projects enable both synchronous and asynchronous collaborative workflows.

Synchronous workflows occur when multiple project team members are connected over multiplayer and are working together on a production.

Asynchronous workflows occur when project team members are not connected but are working on the same project separately. This can occur both in real-time or spread out over time, but the key benefit is the flexibility to work remotely and on each project team member's availability.

For example, if team members A and B are in Flipside Studio and member A makes a new recording, that recording will appear in member B's recordings for that project as soon as the recording has finished syncing to the cloud, or whenever they launch Flipside Studio again.

This enables real-time collaboration between project members even when they're not connected over multiplayer, so member A can make recordings while member B renders video of them as they come in.

## Types of assets that can be shared

### Recordings

Motion capture recordings are always saved to the currently open project so that they're available immediately to everyone in the project.

### Characters, sets, props and skies

Each of these asset types can be added to a project and shared between all project team members so that the 3D artist can set up the characters and sets and the actors can jump in and access them immediately in their part of the production.

This eliminates much of the communication usually needed around sharing assets between team members while also ensuring everyone always has access to what they need, reducing a share to "hey, the new character is up" instead of an awkward share/accept model that often requires several additional steps to be taken by each user.

### Scripts

Scripts for the teleprompter are shared in a project so that every actor has access to the same teleprompter scripts needed to perform their parts. Projects also let you share multiple teleprompter scripts that can be switched in and out during production as you finish recording scenes for your shows.

### Slides

Slideshow slide links are also shared in a project so that one team member can enter the slides to be used by others later on in the production.

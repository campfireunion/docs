# Multiplayer

Flipside Studio supports recording up to **10 people at a time** over distances large or small. These users can be actors or invisible participants in your productions, and multiplayer in Flipside Studio is fully cross-platform across all supported hardware and app store platforms.

## Multi-actor and multi-role

Flipside Studio introduces the concept of users being in different modes which can do different things. These include:

* **Acting mode** - When a user is in character, they're in acting mode and their movements and voice will be recorded.
* **Ghost mode** - When a user switches into ghost mode, they will appear to other users as a virtual headset and controllers but they will be invisible to cameras and in recordings. Ghost mode users can still grab objects and control cameras and other interactive elements in the set, acting as both director and as an invisible hand.
* **Build mode** - Build mode also hides a user from cameras and recordings, and is used during the set dressing and setup stage of production.

Users can switch between these modes at any time, including during recordings.

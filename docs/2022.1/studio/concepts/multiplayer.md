# Multiplayer

Flipside Studio supports recording up to 5 actors at a time over distances large or small. Flipside Studio offers two modes of connecting over multiplayer (peer-to-peer and server-based), so you can choose the mode that's best for your type of production.

## When to use peer-to-peer or server connections

Here's a simple reference to help you choose:

* **Peer-to-peer** is best when all users are physically closer to each other, like in the same local area network or the same city. Peer-to-peer will give you the lowest latency multiplayer in these cases.
* **Server** is best when users are further apart from each other. Server-based connections will give you lower latency as well as more stable connections over greater distances.

## Multi-actor and multi-role

Flipside Studio introduces the concept of users being in different modes which can do different things. These include:

* **Acting mode** - When a user is in character, they're in acting mode and their movements and voice will be recorded.
* **Ghost mode** - When a user switches into ghost mode, they will appear to other users as a virtual headset and controllers but they will be invisible to cameras and in recordings. Ghost mode users can still grab objects and control cameras and other interactive elements in the set, acting as both director and as an invisible hand.
* **Build mode** - Build mode also hides a user from cameras and recordings, and is used during the set dressing and setup stage of production.

Users can switch between these modes at any time, including during recordings.

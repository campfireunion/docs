# Tips and tricks

## Recording the Flipside user interface

If you want to record the Flipside user interface (ie. cameras, preview monitors, menus, etc.), press the **Show UI** button found on both the 2D Camera switcher and in-VR camera switcher.

**----- INSERT SCREENSHOT OF CAMERA SWITCHER -----**

## Going fullscreen

To show or hide the camera switcher interface on the second screen output, **press Alt + F**. Press **Esc** to exit fullscreen.

You can also grab a virtual camera switcher from the Show Tools prop category to do your camera switching in VR.

## Visibility

Ghost Mode, as we often call it, will make your character invisible so you can play director without getting in the way of the shot, or animate props by grabbing them and moving them around. Ghost Mode also gives you the ability to move the world around and scale it up or down by grabbing it with one or two hands.

To go invisible, open the main menu and choose **Visibility** while in character. Press it again to get back into the last character you were in.

Flipside Studio supports exporting audio data for each individual actor's part as WAV files.

You can find the audio export options with these steps:

1. Insert a take for playback and wait for it to load.
2. Take off your headset to see the desktop interface.
3. Click on the button with the take name to open the take editor.

You should see the take editor window open, which should look like this:

From here, you can export the audio for individual parts or all of them at once.

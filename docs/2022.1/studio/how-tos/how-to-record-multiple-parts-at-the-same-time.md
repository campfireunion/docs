# How to record multiple parts at the same time

Now that you've learned [[:how to make a motion capture recording]], let's go over how to record multiple parts at the same time, which involves inviting friends to join you.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Multiplayer** from the main menu.

This will open the **Multiplayer** menu with a list of users in your currently opened project's team.

**Step 2.** Invite some friends.

If the user you want to invite to join you is already on the project team, click on their name to open a dropdown and choose **Invite to collaborate**.

If not, click on the **Friends** tab to find the user you want to invite there, then click on their name to open a dropdown and choose **Invite to collaborate**.

> Note: If you're not friends yet, go to the **Public** tab and search for them to send them a friend request. You must be friends before you can invite users to collaborate, unless you've both been added to a shared project team by another user who is friends with both of you.

**Step 3.** Wait for your friends to join your connection.

They will receive a notification in the Flipside Studio dashboard as well as via email if they're not currently online.

When your friend pops into your session, follow the steps on [[:how to make a motion capture recording]] to continue from here. Flipside Studio automatically records every actor who hasn't made themselves invisible.

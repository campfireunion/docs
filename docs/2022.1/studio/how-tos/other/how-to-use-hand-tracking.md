# How to use hand tracking

> Note: Hand tracking support is a Quest-only feature, however the Valve Index controllers also support basic finger tracking as well.

Here's how to use hand tracking in Flipside Studio:

**Step 1.** Enable hand tracking on your Quest by going to **Settings** then **Hands and Controllers** in the Quest menu.

**Step 2.** Make sure **Hand Tracking** is checked.

**Step 3.** Launch Flipside Studio with your controllers put away. Your hands will be tracked automatically.

**Step 4.** To open or close the main menu with hand tracking enabled, pinch and hold your index finger and thumb together for 2 seconds.

**Step 5.** To click an option in the menus, make a short pinch with your index finger and thumb.

**Step 6.** To open the Quest menu, turn your right hand so it's facing palm up then pinch and hold your index finger and thumb together.

> Tip: Some features such as teleporting aren't supported through hand tracking, but you can switch between using hand tracking and using controllers by picking up your controllers and putting them down again.

# How to use a Perception Neuron motion capture suit

> Note: Perception Neuron is only supported on the desktop versions of Flipside Studio, and does not sync with the VR headset movement so it should be worn standalone.

**Step 1.** Take your headset off and look at Flipside Studio's user switcher interface on your desktop.

**Step 2.** Click on the settings icon along the bottom of the screen. It looks like a little gear icon.

**Step 3.** Click on the **Input** tab.

**Step 4.** Enter your Perception Neuron address, port number, and whether to use TCP or UDP, then change the **Axis Neuron** setting to **Enabled**. Flipside Studio will initiate a connection to the Perception Neuron software.

**Step 5.** Change the **Input Mode** to **Axis Neuron Playback**.

**Step 6.** Click **Calibrate** to run the Perception Neuron calibration. You will need to repeat this step every so often because the IMU sensors in the suit will drift relative to the VR tracking.

# How to use Vive trackers for full body tracking

Flipside Studio supports [Vive trackers](https://www.vive.com/us/vive-tracker) for tracking your feet and waist. For this how-to you'll need a set of Vive trackers as well as straps or clips to attach them to your clothes. We recommend the [Rebuff Reality TrackStrap bundle](https://rebuffreality.com/).

> Note: Vive trackers are only supported in the SteamVR version of Flipside Studio.

## Wearing the trackers

Foot trackers should be worn on the tops of your feet, and should fit reasonably snugly to avoid shaking when you take steps.

The waist tracker should be clipped to your belt or pants, either on the front or back, and in the middle of your body.

## Using the trackers

**Step 1.** Put on your Vive trackers and turn them on.

**Step 2.** Take your headset off and look at Flipside Studio's user switcher interface on your desktop.

**Step 3.** Click on the settings icon along the bottom of the screen. It looks like a little gear icon.

**Step 4.** Click on the **Input** tab.

**Step 5.** Click **Connect Trackers** to start tracking.

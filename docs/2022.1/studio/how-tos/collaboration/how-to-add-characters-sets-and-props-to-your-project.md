# How to add characters, sets, and props to your project

Projects are a great way to share assets between a group of collaborators. Here's how to add shared assets to your projects.

> Note: We'll use characters below but the process is the same for props and sets other than step 5 (choosing a role).

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Characters** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Browse and find the character you want to add to your project.

**Step 3.** Click on the dropdown menu for the character.

**Step 4.** Choose **Add To Project** from the dropdown menu.

**Step 5.** Choose which role to put your character under. The options include:

- **Main** - Main characters.
- **Extra** - Extra characters.
- **Guest** - Guests on your show.
- **Other** - Other characters.

You'll now be able to find your character under the **Project Characters** tab.

Now let's see [[: how to share scripts with your project team]].

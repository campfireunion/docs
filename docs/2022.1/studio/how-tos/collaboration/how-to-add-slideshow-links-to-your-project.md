# How to add slideshow links to your project

In addition to sharing recordings, characters and sets, you can also share slides with the project team that can be loaded into the slideshow prop.

**Step 1.** Visit [www.flipsidexr.com/user](https://www.flipsidexr.com/user) and log in using your Flipside creator login info.

**Step 2.** Click on the **Projects** tab.

**Step 3.** Find your project in the list and click on the **Slides** link.

**Step 4.** Paste your slide links into the text box then click **Save Changes**.

When you reload Flipside Studio, your newly-added slides will be loaded into the slideshow when you have the same project open in-app. For more info, see [[studio / how tos / show tools / how to use the slideshow]].

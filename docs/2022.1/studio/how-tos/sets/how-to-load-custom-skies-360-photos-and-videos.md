# How to load custom skies (360 photos and videos)

Flipside Studio allows you to set custom skies for any set where the sky is visible, which can be 360 panoramic photos or videos.

> Note: 360 video skies are performance intensive and are not recommended for use on Quest.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Props** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Go to **All Props** and choose the **Skies** category. This is where you can access skies in Flipside Studio, including custom skies you've uploaded yourself through the flipsidexr.com web backend.

**Step 3.** Choose a sky from the list and click on it to select it. In a few moments, the sky should change to the sky you just selected.

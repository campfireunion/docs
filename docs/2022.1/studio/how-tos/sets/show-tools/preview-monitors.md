# Preview monitors

Preview monitors let you know what the active camera is seeing while you’re recording your show.

Place preview monitors around your set so you can always have a reference of the framing and camera angle while you’re acting.

> **Important Note:** Your preview monitors will not show up in your recording. If you want them to, see [Recording the Flipside User Interface](/docs/2021.1/tips-and-tricks#recording-the-flipside-user-interface).

# How to use the spotlight

Flipside Studio provides a built-in spotlight prop so you can add real-time lighting to your sets.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Props** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Choose **All Props** then go to the **Show Tools** category.

**Step 3.** Click on the **Light (Spot)** prop in the list to add it to your set.

**Step 4.** Place the spotlight wherever you'd like on your set.

Note that there are limits to how many real-time lights can affect surfaces in VR, due to the heavy performance requirements of real-time lights. This number is one (1) on Quest and defaults to three (3) on desktop VR.

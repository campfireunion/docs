# How to use puppet mode

Puppet mode is a feature that lets you control a character's body with your hand, like a puppet.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Puppet** from the main menu. A virtual puppet will appear in front of your hand.

**Step 2.** Grab the virtual puppet with the hand you want to puppet your character with.

**Step 3.** To switch into puppet mode, press and **hold the trigger** on the same controller. You can switch between regular and puppet modes by pressing and releasing the trigger as many times as you want.

**Step 4.** Let go of the virtual puppet to exit puppet mode.

While in puppet mode, your hand controls the body of your character but your mouth and joystick continue to animate the character's face. The hand that isn't controlling the body controls the movements of both of the character's hands at the same time while active.

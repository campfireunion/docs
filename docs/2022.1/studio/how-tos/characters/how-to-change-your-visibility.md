# How to change your visibility

Flipside Studio lets you change your visibility so you can switch between acting as a character or performing various other roles on set such as being a director or camera operator.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Characters** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Select any character you'd like.

**Step 3.** Reopen the main menu and choose **Visibility**. Your character will disappear, leaving only your controllers visible.

**Step 4.** Click on **Visibility** again. Your character will reappear.

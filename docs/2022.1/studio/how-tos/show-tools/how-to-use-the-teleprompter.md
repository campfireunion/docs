# How to use the teleprompter

Flipside Studio features a teleprompter for actors to be able to refer to scripts during production.

> Note: To customize your scripts, [log into your creator account on flipsidexr.com](flipsidexr.com/user) then go to **Projects** and click on the **Scripts** link for the project you wish to add them to. Scripts belong to a project so they can be shared with the whole project team.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Teleprompter** from the main menu.

This will add a teleprompter controller to your set.

**Step 2.** To change scripts, click on the **Scripts** button along the bottom of the teleprompter controller.

This will bring up a list of available scripts from the currently open project.

**Step 3.** Click on any script to open a preview of it in the scripts list.

**Step 4.** Click **Load Script** to load the script and return to the teleprompter controller.

**Step 5.** Click **Play** to start auto-scrolling through the script, then adjust your scroll speed using the **Scroll Speed** slider.

Each actor gets their own teleprompter controller and the teleprompters are synchronized the whole cast is always on the same page.

# How to draw your own props with the magic pencil

The magic pencil is a special prop in Flipside Studio that lets you draw in 3D, and your drawings themselves become props you can grab and interact with.

**Step 1.** Open the **Props** menu and got to the **All Props > Decor** category.

**Step 2.** Find and add the **Magic Pencil** prop to your set.

**Step 3.** Close the Props menu.

**Step 4.** Grab the magic pencil prop then, while holding it, press your index finger trigger to begin drawing.

**Step 5.** Use your joystick while holding the magic pencil to change the colour that you're drawing with.

**Step 6.** Grab your drawing and see that you can move it around. You've now made your own simple prop using the magic pencil.

> Tip: If you grab a drawing or share the magic pencil with another user, the next time anyone draws with the magic pencil will start a new drawing.

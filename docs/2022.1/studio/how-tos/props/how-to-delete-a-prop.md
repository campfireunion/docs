# How to delete a prop

Here's how to remove a prop from your set.

**Step 1.** Make sure the **Props** menu is open. Whenever this menu is open, props can be modified instead of interacting with their regular behaviours.

**Step 2.** Grab the prop with one of your controllers and gently toss it over your shoulder behind you like you're throwing it away. This is the quickest way to delete a prop using a gesture.

**Step 3.** Grab a prop and press the menu button on that controller while holding it. When you're holding a prop, this button opens the prop properties menu instead of the main menu.

**Step 4.** Click on the **Delete Prop** button on the prop properties menu. This is the other way of deleting props.

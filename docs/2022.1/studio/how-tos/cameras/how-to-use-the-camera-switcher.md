# How to use the camera switcher

Once you've set up a few cameras around your set, you're ready to start cutting between them.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Camera Switcher** from the main menu. This will add the camera switcher to your scene.

The camera switcher features a large preview of the currently active camera with a list of other camera positions on the right and the switcher controls along the bottom.

> Note: Unlike cameras where you can place as many as you want around your set, there is only one camera switcher that you can take with you or recall at any time from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Click on any of the camera previews to cut to a different camera.

The last preview is a mirror of your own point of view so you can also capture POV shots in addition to placed cameras.

**Step 3.** Click on the **Move** button, then click on one of the inactive camera previews.

The **Cut** and **Move** buttons toggle between cutting cameras and moving between them. Moving between cameras creates seamless camera movement between the currently active camera position and any new one you select.

**Step 4.** Click **Show UI** in the controls along the bottom.

Notice how the camera output now shows user interface elements. You can use this to capture the Flipside Studio user interface, for example to do walkthrough videos.

You've now used all the major features of the camera switcher. Let's look at [[:how to adjust your camera settings]] next.

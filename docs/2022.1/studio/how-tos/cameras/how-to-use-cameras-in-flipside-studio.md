# How to use cameras in Flipside Studio

Flipside Studio features a powerful camera system that lets you place cameras around your set and cut or move between them to create the show you envision. Here's how to use cameras in Flipside Studio.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Camera** from the main menu.

This will add a new camera to your scene. You can add as many cameras as you need.

**Step 2.** Explore the camera options by clicking through the icons along the bottom of the camera. These include:

- **Focal Length** - Adjusts the focal length of the camera. A longer focal length narrows the angle of view and increases zoom. A shorter one widens the angle of view and decreases zoom.
- **Horizontal Lock** - Locks the camera's rotation to always align with the horizon.
- **Photo** - Changes the camera into photo-taking mode for taking still shots.
- **Flip** - Flips the direction of the camera, similar to flipping between the forward and self-facing cameras on a smartphone.

**Step 3.** Grab the camera and move it around.

Take some time to move the camera around and get a feel for how it moves. Try it with and without the horizontal lock enabled. You'll notice camera movements are smoothed so that the jitter from your hand is not reflected in the shot.

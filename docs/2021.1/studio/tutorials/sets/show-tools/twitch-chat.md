# Twitch Chat

The Twitch Chat prop lets you view and display your Twitch channel's chat inside your Flipside shows.

**To connect a Twitch channel with the Twitch Chat prop, follow these steps:** 

1. On the 2D camera switcher, click on the **Settings** icon, select the **General** tab, then enter your Twitch channel into the **Twitch Channel ID** field and click **Save**.
2. Go to the **Show Tools** category of the **Set Builder** palette and add the **Twitch** prop to your scene.
3. Exit **Set Builder** mode by choosing another category, such as **Characters** or **Sets**.

Your channel's chat messages should start appearing automatically on your Twitch prop.

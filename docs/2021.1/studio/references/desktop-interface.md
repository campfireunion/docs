# Desktop interface

The desktop interface gives a director the ability to controlling cameras from outside of VR, as well as access Flipside Studio's settings and export features.

The main window area is your active camera output. Along the bottom are the director controls. On the right are previews for each camera position.

The director controls work with [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) to record and stream shows to platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and others. See [[Studio / Tutorials / Recording / Editing your show / setting up OBS Studio]] for info on how to setup and configure Flipside Studio's OBS integration.

The options on the bottom include:

* **Record/Stop Recording** - Starts and stops an OBS video recording.
* **Stream/Stop Streaming** - Starts and stops an OBS livestream.
* **Connect/Disconnect** - Connects Flipside Studio to OBS. While connected, Flipside Studio is able to control OBS behind-the-scenes.
* **Play/Stop** - Play or stop playing a loaded take (aka motion capture recording). _Note: Visible only when a take is loaded._
* **Take Name** - Shows the currently loaded take name and opens the export window. _Note: Visible only when a take is loaded._
* **Fullscreen** - Hides the desktop interface so you can stream or capture the full screen output.
* **Ghost Mode** - Changes the in-VR user in and out of [Ghost Mode](/docs/2021.1/studio/references/tips-and-tricks#ghost-mode).
* **Show/Hide UI** - Shows or hides the Flipside Studio user interface from cameras. Useful for recording tutorials or playthroughs.
* **Settings** - Opens the settings window.
* **Cut** - Sets the active camera transition to cut from one position to another.
* **Move** - Sets the active camera transition to move from one position to another.

### Exiting fullscreen

While in fullscreen, you can press **Esc** to bring the desktop interface back into view.

If you move your mouse over the window while in fullscreen, a notice will appear along the top that says _"Press Esc to exit fullscreen"_.

# Other settings

The settings window in Flipside Studio has a few other useful features, including:

* **Slideshow Links** - A list of links to photos and videos for the [slideshow prop](/docs/2021.1/studio/tutorials/sets/interactive-props/slideshow). This is found under the **Slideshow** tab.
* **Teleprompter Text** - A script that will be loaded into the [teleprompter prop](/docs/2021.1/studio/tutorials/sets/show-tools#teleprompter). This is found under the **Teleprompter** tab.
* **Reporting a problem** - You can report a bug or problem you're having directly in Flipside Studio under the **Support** tab. This sends us your report along with your hardware specs and the output log from your current session.

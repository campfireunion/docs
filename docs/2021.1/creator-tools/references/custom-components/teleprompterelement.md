# TeleprompterElement

Attaching a TeleprompterElement alongside a TextMeshPro text object can turn that text element into a teleprompter in Flipside Studio.

Put the object on the **UI** layer in Unity to make it visible only to actors and hide it from cameras, letting you make teleprompters that fit seamlessly into your custom sets.

Combine this with buttons connected to a [[:FlipsideActions]] component and you can build custom teleprompter controls as well.

# TwitchActions

TwitchActions is a component that lets you define custom commands that your viewers can type into the Twitch chat which are connected to events in your custom sets or on your custom characters (e.g., triggering a particle burst or sound effect). Commands always begin with an exclamation mark (e.g., `!command`).

The example scene `FlipsideCreatorTools/Examples/Example-TwitchActions` shows how they are set up. The `!vote` command ties into a **TriggerCounter** so that the command must be entered five times in order to trigger an event.

# TargetElement

The TargetElement component assigns points when a BulletElement or ThrowableElement hits it. Targets can override the point value of the bullet or throwable with its own value if the **Override Points On Hit** property is checked and the **Add Points On Hit** property is set to the specified points to award the shooter or thrower.

You can tie event handlers to the following list of events:

* **OnHit** - The target was hit.

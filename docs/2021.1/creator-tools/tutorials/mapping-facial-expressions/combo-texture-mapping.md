# Combo-texture mapping

This method is similar to the [[:texture mapping]], except it supports a different set of texture options. Where [[:texture mapping]] supports each viseme shape being applied to the mouth of the character, combo-textures support the following options:

* Mouth open and closed (no visemes)
* Eyes open and closed (blinking!)
* Four facial expressions (happy, sad, surprised, and angry)

Note that the two can be combined together to achieve more complex texture-based animations. For example, you could apply the regular [[:texture mapping]] to the mouth to achieve more detailed viseme-based mouth movement, and use combo-textures to add blinking eyes and facial expressions.

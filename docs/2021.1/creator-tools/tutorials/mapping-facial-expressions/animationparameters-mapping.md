# AnimationParameters mapping

This method is similar to the [[:animation mapping]], but instead of mapping to layers in the animation controller it maps to [AnimationParameters](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationParameters.html) variables defined within the animator controller, letting you affect the flow of the animation state machine. This gives you finer control over how animations are applied to faces.

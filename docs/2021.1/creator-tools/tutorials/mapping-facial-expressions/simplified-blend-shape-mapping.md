# Simplified blend shape mapping

This method is almost the same as standard [[:blend shape mapping]], except it only uses one shape for lip syncing which represents the "open mouth" state.

The other features like eye movement, blinking, and facial expressions (happy, sad, surprised, angry) all work exactly the same as the standard blend shape mapping.

Since this method only uses the concept of mouth open/closed, it works great for animating Muppet-style characters.
